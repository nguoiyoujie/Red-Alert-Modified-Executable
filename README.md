# Red-Alert-Modified-Executable
A test mod for the good ol' Red Alert game

----------
## About this project

This is a test mod built to test the capabilities of the executable patch modifications that I was also developing above Iran's old work. This can be used as a test bed for any mod that wishes to use this facility.

This mod hosts the following:

 - A build of the RA95 3.03 's' executable from https://github.com/nguoiyoujie/ra303p-iran 
 
 - A map editor in the \MapEditor folder, built from https://github.com/nguoiyoujie/Red-Alert-Mission-Editor

 - Necessary files to run the game
 
 - Additional content files, to act as a mod to test this game, namely:
 
  -- sc-lovalmidas.mix, which contains 3rd-party content for testing added objects (new technotypes). As far as possible, a contents file is hosted within this mix file to credit the owners where known.
  
  -- Modified rules.ini and aftermath.ini, to support some of the modded changes
  
  -- ra95_testmap.bat, used to test the new command-line arguments support for the game
  
  -- Missions [cmuXXeX.ini]! For some good fun!
